// 24th August 2016 - Trying to seperate the sequence logic but although function is firing it is not running the sequence.  Something to do with reference the labels perhaps...

//Brick Breaker - SR

//incorporate bottom edge logic to brick breaker

//Dropping Blocks - SG

//Add game state, add new classes 
    //: added gamestates, but need to fix contact between ball and block into game over state, not curently working -  SG

//General concepts

//*When an objects hits the bottom, didcontact firing twice (dropping blocks as example) - Complete        - added shapenode at bottom of frame, to stop duplicate calls to contact event

//Check out the folder structure of Dropping Blocks, think this makes sense, easier to navigate and segregate games?
